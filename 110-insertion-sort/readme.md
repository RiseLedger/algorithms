# Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

## Algorithm
// Sort an arr[] of size n
1. insertionSort(arr, n)
2. Loop from i = 1 to n -1
3. Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0â€¦i-1]

# Run from terminal
```sh
node insertionSort '[list]'
```
where `[list]` is array you want to sort
