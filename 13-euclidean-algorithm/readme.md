# Euclidean Algorithm
In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm[a], or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

The is the granddaddy of all algorithms, because it is the oldest nontrivial algorithm that has survived to the present day.
