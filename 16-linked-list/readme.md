# Linked list
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

## Related data structure
Both stacks and queues are often implemented using linked lists, and simply restrict the type of operations which are supported.

A hash table may use linked lists to store the chains of items that hash to the same position in the hash table.
