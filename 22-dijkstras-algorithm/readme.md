# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

## Key points
* Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a weighted graph.
* The graph can either be directed or undirected.
* Dijkstra's algorithm works when all the weights are positive.
* If you have negative weights, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Above graph will be used as an example to show how Dijkstra's algorithm work.

**Input:**
- Adjacency matrix
- Start Vertex

**Output:**
- Array of nodes with distances
