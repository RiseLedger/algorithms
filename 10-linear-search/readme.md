# Linear Search
In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.

## Run from terminal
```sh
node linearSearch '[list]' x
```
where `[list]` is array of sorted number and `x` is the number you search.
* If x matches with an element, return the index.
* If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.
